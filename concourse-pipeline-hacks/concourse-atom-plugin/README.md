# Preview Concourse pipelines in ATOM

If you use the ATOM editor for coding Concourse pipelines, then there is a great tool available to preview pipelines directly from the editor's user interface: the [concourse-vis plugin](https://atom.io/packages/concourse-vis) by danhigham.

The plugin allows you to visualize an entire CI pipeline, to pan and zoom into specific sections of it and also to click-and-jump into the the corresponding source code section of any resource that you click on the pipeline graph (which in my opinion is one of the best features of the plugin, as it makes navigation through a pipeline's source code a lot easier).
